# TryHackMe — Basic Pentesting  
*Difficulty:* Easy  
*Category:* Web, Enumeration, SSH, Privilege Escalation  

---

## 🧭 Overview  
This room introduces basic penetration testing methodology.  
The goal is to identify services, enumerate them, and gain access using weak credentials and misconfigurations.

---

## 🛰 Recon & Enumeration  

### 🔎 Nmap Scan
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap.txt <TARGET-IP>

*Findings:*
- Port 22: OpenSSH  
- Port 80: Apache web server  
- Port 139/445: SMB  
- Port 3306: MySQL  

### 🔎 Gobuster (Web Directories)

gobuster dir -u http://<TARGET-IP>/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

*Findings:*
- /uploads
- /development

---

## 🧩 Vulnerability Identified  
- Weak SSH password on user account  
- Exposed development notes revealing credentials  
- Incorrect permissions allowing privilege escalation  

---

## 🚪 Exploitation (High-Level)  
1. Use gobuster to find dev notes → reveals username  
2. Attempt SSH brute force (hydra) → weak password works  
3. Inside the machine → run sudo -l  
4. Misconfiguration allows running script as root  
5. Escalation achieved

---

## 🛡 Mitigations  
- Enforce strong password policy  
- Remove sensitive notes from web server  
- Restrict file permissions  
- Disable unused services  
- Configure SSH to prevent brute force attempts

## 📝 Lessons Learned  
- Importance of enumeration  
- Identifying weak credentials  
- Understanding misconfigurations  
- Thinking systematically like an attacker
